# OpenAI API-Powered Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Assistant

Welcome to my first project utilizing the OpenAI API! The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) tool. By giving it a CSV file, the assistant can answer various questions and outline the necessary steps for performing EDA on the given data.

## Overview

This project leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 to assist with EDA by:
- Providing the number of rows and columns.
- Detailing steps for data cleaning.
- Answering questions related to feature engineering and data analysis.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Summarization**: Reads a CSV file and provides a summary including the number of rows, columns, column names, data types, a sample of the data, missing values, and unique rows.
- **EDA Guidance**: Offers specific steps to clean and analyze the data based on the provided summary.
- **Interactive Q&A**: Allows users to ask questions about the dataset and receive detailed and relevant answers.
